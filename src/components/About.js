                I am a frontend developer learning backend development.
                I enjoy the design aspect of development and want
                to create programs that are accessible and usable;
                learning full stack development will help me
                reach that goal. I am interested in Game Programming,
                Machine Learning, and exploring Artificial Intelligence concepts.
            </p>
